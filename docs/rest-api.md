# REST API & FreqUI

## FreqUI

Freqtrade provides a builtin webserver, which can serve [FreqUI](https://github.com/freqtrade/frequi), the freqtrade UI.

By default, the UI is not included in the installation (except for docker images), and must be installed explicitly with `freqtrade install-ui`.
This same command can also be used to update freqUI, should there be a new release.

Once the bot is started in trade / dry-run mode (with `freqtrade trade`) - the UI will be available under the configured port below (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8080`).

!!! info "Alpha release"
    FreqUI is still considered an alpha release - if you encounter bugs or inconsistencies please open a [FreqUI issue](https://github.com/freqtrade/frequi/issues/new/choose).

!!! Note "developers"
    Developers should not use this method, but instead use the method described in the [freqUI repository](https://github.com/freqtrade/frequi) to get the source-code of freqUI.

## Configuration

Enable the rest API by adding the api_server section to your configuration and setting `api_server.enabled` to `true`.

Sample configuration:

``` json
    "api_server": {
        "enabled": true,
        "listen_ip_address": "127.0.0.1",
        "listen_port": 8080,
        "verbosity": "error",
        "enable_openapi": false,
        "jwt_secret_key": "somethingrandom",
        "CORS_origins": [],
        "username": "Freqtrader",
        "password": "SuperSecret1!",
        "ws_token": "sercet_Ws_t0ken"
    },
```

!!! Danger "Security warning"
    By default, the configuration listens on localhost only (so it's not reachable from other systems). We strongly recommend to not expose this API to the internet and choose a strong, unique password, since others will potentially be able to control your bot.

??? Note "API/UI Access on a remote servers"
    If you're running on a VPS, you should consider using either a ssh tunnel, or setup a VPN (openVPN, wireguard) to connect to your bot.
    This will ensure that freqUI is not directly exposed to the internet, which is not recommended for security reasons (freqUI does not support https out of the box).
    Setup of these tools is not part of this tutorial, however many good tutorials can be found on the internet.

You can then access the API by going to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/ping` in a browser to check if the API is running correctly.
This should return the response:

``` output
{"status":"pong"}
```

All other endpoints return sensitive info and require authentication and are therefore not available through a web browser.

### Security

To generate a secure password, best use a password manager, or use the below code.

``` python
import secrets
secrets.token_hex()
```

!!! Hint "JWT token"
    Use the same method to also generate a JWT secret key (`jwt_secret_key`).

!!! Danger "Password selection"
    Please make sure to select a very strong, unique password to protect your bot from unauthorized access.
    Also change `jwt_secret_key` to something random (no need to remember this, but it'll be used to encrypt your session, so it better be something unique!).

### Configuration with docker

If you run your bot using docker, you'll need to have the bot listen to incoming connections. The security is then handled by docker.

``` json
    "api_server": {
        "enabled": true,
        "listen_ip_address": "0.0.0.0",
        "listen_port": 8080,
        "username": "Freqtrader",
        "password": "SuperSecret1!",
        //...
    },
```

Make sure that the following 2 lines are available in your docker-compose file:

```yml
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8080:8080"
```

!!! Danger "Security warning"
    By using `8080:8080` in the docker port mapping, the API will be available to everyone connecting to the server under the correct port, so others may be able to control your bot.

## Rest API

### Consuming the API

You can consume the API by using the script `scripts/rest_client.py`.
The client script only requires the `requests` module, so Freqtrade does not need to be installed on the system.

``` bash
python3 scripts/rest_client.py <command> [optional parameters]
```

By default, the script assumes `127.0.0.1` (localhost) and port `8080` to be used, however you can specify a configuration file to override this behaviour.

#### Minimalistic client config

``` json
{
    "api_server": {
        "enabled": true,
        "listen_ip_address": "0.0.0.0",
        "listen_port": 8080,
        "username": "Freqtrader",
        "password": "SuperSecret1!",
        //...
    }
}
```

``` bash
python3 scripts/rest_client.py --config rest_config.json <command> [optional parameters]
```

### Message WebSocket

The API Server includes a websocket endpoint for subscribing to RPC messages from the freqtrade Bot.
This can be used to consume real-time data from your bot, such as entry/exit fill messages, whitelist changes, populated indicators for pairs, and more.

This is also used to setup [Producer/Consumer mode](producer-consumer.md) in Freqtrade.

Assuming your rest API is set to `127.0.0.1` on port `8080`, the endpoint is available at `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/message/ws`.

To access the websocket endpoint, the `ws_token` is required as a query parameter in the endpoint URL.

To generate a safe `ws_token` you can run the following code:

``` python
>>> import secrets
>>> secrets.token_urlsafe(25)
'hZ-y58LXyX_HZ8O1cJzVyN6ePWrLpNQv4Q'
```

You would then add that token under `ws_token` in your `api_server` config. Like so:

``` json
"api_server": {
    "enabled": true,
    "listen_ip_address": "127.0.0.1",
    "listen_port": 8080,
    "verbosity": "error",
    "enable_openapi": false,
    "jwt_secret_key": "somethingrandom",
    "CORS_origins": [],
    "username": "Freqtrader",
    "password": "SuperSecret1!",
    "ws_token": "hZ-y58LXyX_HZ8O1cJzVyN6ePWrLpNQv4Q" // <-----
},
```

You can now connect to the endpoint at `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/message/ws?token=hZ-y58LXyX_HZ8O1cJzVyN6ePWrLpNQv4Q`.

!!! Danger "Reuse of example tokens"
    Please do not use the above example token. To make sure you are secure, generate a completely new token.

#### Using the WebSocket

Once connected to the WebSocket, the bot will broadcast RPC messages to anyone who is subscribed to them. To subscribe to a list of messages, you must send a JSON request through the WebSocket like the one below. The `data` key must be a list of message type strings.

``` json
{
  "type": "subscribe",
  "data": ["whitelist", "analyzed_df"] // A list of string message types
}
```

For a list of message types, please refer to the RPCMessageType enum in `freqtrade/enums/rpcmessagetype.py`

Now anytime those types of RPC messages are sent in the bot, you will receive them through the WebSocket as long as the connection is active. They typically take the same form as the request:

``` json
{
  "type": "analyzed_df",
  "data": {
      "key": ["NEO/BTC", "5m", "spot"],
      "df": {}, // The dataframe
      "la": "2022-09-08 22:14:41.457786+00:00"
  }
}
```

### OpenAPI interface

To enable the builtin openAPI interface (Swagger UI), specify `"enable_openapi": true` in the api_server configuration.
This will enable the Swagger UI at the `/docs` endpoint. By default, that's running at http://localhost:8080/docs - but it'll depend on your settings.

### Advanced API usage using JWT tokens

!!! Note
    The below should be done in an application (a Freqtrade REST API client, which fetches info via API), and is not intended to be used on a regular basis.

Freqtrade's REST API also offers JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
You can login using the following command, and subsequently use the resulting access_token.

``` bash
> curl -X POST --user Freqtrader http://localhost:8080/api/v1/token/login
{"access_token":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE1ODkxMTk2ODEsIm5iZiI6MTU4OTExOTY4MSwianRpIjoiMmEwYmY0NWUtMjhmOS00YTUzLTlmNzItMmM5ZWVlYThkNzc2IiwiZXhwIjoxNTg5MTIwNTgxLCJpZGVudGl0eSI6eyJ1IjoiRnJlcXRyYWRlciJ9LCJmcmVzaCI6ZmFsc2UsInR5cGUiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.qt6MAXYIa-l556OM7arBvYJ0SDI9J8bIk3_glDujF5g","refresh_token":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE1ODkxMTk2ODEsIm5iZiI6MTU4OTExOTY4MSwianRpIjoiZWQ1ZWI3YjAtYjMwMy00YzAyLTg2N2MtNWViMjIxNWQ2YTMxIiwiZXhwIjoxNTkxNzExNjgxLCJpZGVudGl0eSI6eyJ1IjoiRnJlcXRyYWRlciJ9LCJ0eXBlIjoicmVmcmVzaCJ9.d1AT_jYICyTAjD0fiQAr52rkRqtxCjUGEMwlNuuzgNQ"}

> access_token="eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE1ODkxMTk2ODEsIm5iZiI6MTU4OTExOTY4MSwianRpIjoiMmEwYmY0NWUtMjhmOS00YTUzLTlmNzItMmM5ZWVlYThkNzc2IiwiZXhwIjoxNTg5MTIwNTgxLCJpZGVudGl0eSI6eyJ1IjoiRnJlcXRyYWRlciJ9LCJmcmVzaCI6ZmFsc2UsInR5cGUiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.qt6MAXYIa-l556OM7arBvYJ0SDI9J8bIk3_glDujF5g"
# Use access_token for authentication
> curl -X GET --header "Authorization: Bearer ${access_token}" http://localhost:8080/api/v1/count

```

Since the access token has a short timeout (15 min) - the `token/refresh` request should be used periodically to get a fresh access token:

``` bash
> curl -X POST --header "Authorization: Bearer ${refresh_token}"http://localhost:8080/api/v1/token/refresh
{"access_token":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE1ODkxMTk5NzQsIm5iZiI6MTU4OTExOTk3NCwianRpIjoiMDBjNTlhMWUtMjBmYS00ZTk0LTliZjAtNWQwNTg2MTdiZDIyIiwiZXhwIjoxNTg5MTIwODc0LCJpZGVudGl0eSI6eyJ1IjoiRnJlcXRyYWRlciJ9LCJmcmVzaCI6ZmFsc2UsInR5cGUiOiJhY2Nlc3MifQ.1seHlII3WprjjclY6DpRhen0rqdF4j6jbvxIhUFaSbs"}
```

### CORS

This whole section is only necessary in cross-origin cases (where you multiple bot API's running on `localhost:8081`, `localhost:8082`, ...), and want to combine them into one FreqUI instance.

??? info "Technical explanation"
    All web-based front-ends are subject to [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
    Since most of the requests to the Freqtrade API must be authenticated, a proper CORS policy is key to avoid security problems.
    Also, the standard disallows `*` CORS policies for requests with credentials, so this setting must be set appropriately.

Users can allow access from different origin URL's to the bot API via the `CORS_origins` configuration setting.
It consists of a list of allowed URL's that are allowed to consume resources from the bot's API.

Assuming your application is deployed as `https://frequi.freqtrade.io/home/` - this would mean that the following configuration becomes necessary:

```jsonc
{
    //...
    "jwt_secret_key": "somethingrandom",
    "CORS_origins": ["https://frequi.freqtrade.io"],
    //...
}
```

In the following (pretty common) case, FreqUI is accessible on `http://localhost:8080/trade` (this is what you see in your navbar when navigating to freqUI).
![freqUI url](assets/frequi_url.png)

The correct configuration for this case is `http://localhost:8080` - the main part of the URL including the port.

```jsonc
{
    //...
    "jwt_secret_key": "somethingrandom",
    "CORS_origins": ["http://localhost:8080"],
    //...
}
```

!!! Note
    We strongly recommend to also set `jwt_secret_key` to something random and known only to yourself to avoid unauthorized access to your bot.
